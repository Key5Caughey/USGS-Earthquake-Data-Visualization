# Leaflet Challenge 15

## Leaflet Challenge part 1/ Create Earthquake Visulation Map

Collect data from USGS GeoJSON summary format. Review data summary. Import data using Leafleet , create map to plot all earthquakes from 
data set based on long and lat. Choose a long/lat for center location. Use circle markers for long and lat and let size of circle be for 
the magnitude of earthquake and color be for depth of earthquake. Use bindPopup to provide additional information when clicked. 
Create a legend to provide context for map.

## Leaflet Challenge part 2/ Gather and Plot more Data

Add a tectonic plate layer to map to show better correlation between earthquakes and locations. Add a secondary control to map so 
you are able to toggle from tectonic plates and earthquakes or have both showing. Didn't have time to do the other base maps though 
they looked and sounded very interesting
