# Leaflet Challenge 15

## BACKGROUND
The USGS(United States Geological Survey) is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Tools and Techniques Used
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, D3.js**
- Created an Interactive Map with Leaflet
- Data Loading and Processing with D3.js
- Styling Earthquake Markers Based on Data, Binding Popups to Markers, Adding a Legend
- Conditional Statements: switch/case and if statements are used to determine color and size based on earthquake data.
- Looping Structures: for loop is used to render the legend and manage the intervals for depth ranges.

**All data from USGS GeoJSON, all earthquakes past 7 days**

## Leaflet Challenge part 1/ Create Earthquake Visulation Map

Collect data from USGS GeoJSON summary format. Review data summary. Import data using Leafleet , create map to plot all earthquakes from 
data set based on long and lat. Choose a long/lat for center location. Use circle markers for long and lat and let size of circle be for 
the magnitude of earthquake and color be for depth of earthquake. Use bindPopup to provide additional information when clicked. 
Create a legend to provide context for map.

## Leaflet Challenge part 2/ Gather and Plot more Data

Add a tectonic plate layer to map to show better correlation between earthquakes and locations. Add a secondary control to map so 
you are able to toggle from tectonic plates and earthquakes or have both showing. Didn't have time to do the other base
maps, like Greyscale, though they looked and sounded very interesting
